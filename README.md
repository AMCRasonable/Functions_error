# Toy Shop Smart Contract

## Overview
The ToyShop smart contract allows users to manage their balance and purchase toys worth 500 units. It includes functions for depositing funds, checking the balance, and purchasing toys while ensuring that the contract behaves safely and as expected.

This contract is written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain and uses basic mechanisms such as require, assert, and revert for error handling..

## Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Functions_error.sol). Copy and paste the code to the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Functions_error.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
